# moov-io/go-ftp

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Go FTP provides a simple FTP [client interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/go-ftp#Client) for uploading, listing, and opening files on an FTP server.

```go
type Client interface {
	Ping() error
	Close() error

	Open(path string) (*File, error)
	Reader(path string) (*File, error)

	Delete(path string) error
	UploadFile(path string, contents io.ReadCloser) error

	ListFiles(dir string) ([]string, error)
	Walk(dir string, fn fs.WalkDirFunc) error
}
```

The library also includes a [mock client implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/go-ftp#MockClient) which uses a local filesystem temporary directory for testing.

## Example

Here is an example of how to push file to an FTP server using this module:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	ftp "github.com/moov-io/go-ftp"
)

// A simple FTP file upload using go-ftp.
func main() {
	// Create an FTP client using the server's host and port
	clientConfig := ftp.ClientConfig{
		Hostname: "ftp.server.com:21",
		Username: "admin",
		Password: "admin",
	}

	client, err := ftp.NewClient(clientConfig)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Check if the FTP client is reachable
	if err := client.Ping(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if client != nil {
		defer client.Close()
	}

	// Open the file to be uploaded
	fileData, err := os.Open("file.txt")

	// Upload the file to the destination path
	err = client.UploadFile(filepath.Join("/tmp", "file.txt"), fileData)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started!

This project uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) and Go v1.18 or newer. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/go-ftp/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Releasing

To make a release of go-ftp simply open a pull request with `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.go` updated with the next version number and details. You'll also need to push the tag (i.e. `git push origin v1.0.0`) to origin in order for CI to make the release.

### Testing

We maintain a comprehensive suite of unit tests and recommend table-driven testing when a particular function warrants several very similar test cases. After starting the services with Docker Compose run all tests with `go test ./...`. Current overall coverage can be found on [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/moov-io/go-ftp/).
